# maze generation and solving written in C++

## How it works:
1. Enter the size of your maze (must be an odd number)
2. Select between saving it as a png, solving it, generating a new maze, and exiting the program
3. Done!

## Notes
* There are three types of solving algorithms so far, right turn only and left turn only
* While solving, the "*" character represents the correct path, and the "." character means the mazes backtracking path
* Mazes beyond 200 notice longer waiting times
