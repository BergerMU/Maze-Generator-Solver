# A maze generation and solving program written in C++

## How it works:
1. Enter the size of your maze (must be an odd number)
2. Select between saving it to an image, solving it, generating a new maze, and exiting the program
3. Done!

## Notes
* The maze only has one type of solving algorithm right now: the "follow the right wall" algorithm. More are planned to be added in the future
* While solving, the "*" character represents the correct path, and the "." character means the mazes backtracking path
* Mazes beyond 200 notice longer waiting times
